## Bonjour 👋

I'm Chloe, an Engineer in Physics with 10yrs+ experience in Project and Product management. I'm endlessly curious and never sure if it's a quality or a flaw, but anyway, here I am happily exploring and putting my hands in the dirt. Yeah! <br>
**Work experience** : AI (Inference, Agentic, GPU), Cloud Computing (Infrastructure, OEM-ODM, Docker payloads, MPI, etc.), Technical Program Management (Crossteam coordination, Benchmarking, Documentation), AI Consultant (Real Estate, Architecture, Entertainment), Data Science and Public Speaking. <br>
**Hobbies** : AI-ML Hackathons, ultratrail, bicycling around the world and learning FPGA. <br>
**Location** : Currently in SF/CA (US) 🇺🇸
